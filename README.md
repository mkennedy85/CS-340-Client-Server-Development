# CS-340-Client-Server-Development

## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

When developing a program it is important to identify the way that you want to make the connection between what you present to your users, and the data necessary to drive that interface. When you identify a common pattern, such as this one, by developing a portable database interface, you can reuse it across other programs.

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

By first developing the necessary interface to your data, you can then more easily implement the experience that the requirements demand. This is in contrast to creating these connections to the data as you build the frontend experience.

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists solve problems through technology, by collecting the requirements for solving real-world problems and implementing solutions for others to leverage the outputs of. This means that utilizing technology you can address problems in all areas of life.
